👨🏻‍💻 Tech Stack Used HTML5 – for structuring the game layout

CSS3 – for responsive design and visual styling

JavaScript (Vanilla) – for game logic and interactivity

🧠 What is Vanilla JavaScript? Vanilla JavaScript refers to plain, native JavaScript — the core programming language of the web — without using any external libraries or frameworks like React, jQuery, Angular, or Vue.

In this project, all the game logic (like detecting a win, switching turns, handling clicks, and resetting the game) is written using pure JavaScript. That means:

No dependencies

Lightweight and fast

Easy to understand and modify

Runs directly in the browser

Why Use Vanilla JavaScript? It's the foundation of all JavaScript frameworks.

It teaches you core concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic.

Perfect for small projects like games, calculators, and dynamic web pages.

📌 In This Project Vanilla JavaScript is used to:

Handle player turns (X and O)

Detect winning combinations

Update the game status dynamically

Restart the game without refreshing the page
